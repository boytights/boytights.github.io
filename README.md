A picture wall of boys wearing tights: in different colors, different styles, and different ages

About
-
Something used to satisfy the site maker's unusual (yet somewhat specific) stocking fetish.

This page is originally released in early 2022, on Google Sites. It was just an effort to concentrate pictures (of boys wearing tights of course) I like into one single place, so I don't have to alternate between dozens of tabs when I jack off.

On August 2025, I finally decided to migrate the page — because Google Sites is too uncustomizable. I wanted to try out new layouts.

Pictures
-
Everything on the wall comes from a lot of different sources. Google, Pinterest, YouTube videos, obscure websites...

Some pictures were upscaled with online tools, chiefly [PicWish](https://picwish.com/unblur-image-portrait), or edited with whatever program I prefer to use.

Most pictures depict real people, but some are AI generated. Some of those AI pictures are directly downloaded from the web, but I generate (and adjust) some too.

Why AI? Because that's how I can get almost exactly what I want to see. It can even make 𝓷𝓲𝓬𝓮𝓻 scenes that simply don't exist in real life.

Oh, some pictures are also "real + AI." A real "base" picture with some enhancements made with AI.

I mainly use [Stable Diffusion Web](https://stablediffusionweb.com/) as my main image generator. It gives nice results, and the site is really easy to abuse: just set up a [Proton mailbox](https://protonmail.com), add as many email alias as you want... boom, now you can create so many new accounts and render their credits cooldown useless!

Layout

Coded by ChatGPT. Not sure where the script came from. It's called Masonry.js anyways.

Legality?
-
Definitely not safe for work. Folks from the FBI still haven't knocked on my door yet.
