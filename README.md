A picture wall of boys wearing tights

A picture wall of boys wearing tights. Something to satisfy the site maker's unusual fetish.

This page is originally released in early 2022, on Google Sites. It was just an effort to concentrate pictures (of boy wearing tights of course) I like into one single place, so I don't have to alternate between dozens of tabs when I jack off.

On August 2025, I finally decided to migrate the page — because Google Sites is too uncustomizable.

Pictures

Everything on the wall comes from a lot of different sources.

Some were upscaled with online tools, chiefly [PicWish](https://picwish.com/unblur-image-portrait), or edited with whatever program I prefer to use.

Most pictures depict real people, but some are AI generated. Some of those AI pictures are downloaded from the web, but I generate some too. I mainly use [Stable Diffusion Web](https://www.stablediffusionweb.com).

Why AI? Because that's how I can get exactly what I want to see. It can even make 𝓷𝓲𝓬𝓮𝓻 scenes that simply don't exist in real life.

Oh, some pictures are also "real + AI." A real "base" picture with some enhancements made with AI.

Coded by ChatGPT. Not sure where the script came from. It's called Masonry.js anyways.
